## Accessing UCSB GitHub

Repositories that are part of UCSB Github may be:
 - Public: Accessible to anyone on the internet, without need for a Github account
 - Internal: Accessible to all UCSB organization members
 - Private: Accessible only to specific individuals or teams

In order to access an "Internal" or "Private" repository, users must:
 - [ ] Have an active Github account  AND 
 - [ ] Be invited to a UCSB Github repository, organization or project

## Inviting UCSB Users to an Organization or Repository

Here's a basic overview of how the process will work for most people at UCSB:

1. Sally Student already has a github account that she set up for herself a while ago, but Frank Faculty does not have a Github account at all.
2. Frank must follow the Github instructions for how to [create a new github account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). Once he's done that he can receive an invite.
3. Regina, who owns a UCSB Github repository wants to work with Sally and Frank, so Regina invites them via their Github account
3. Sally and Frank can now receive an email invitation that includes details and a button to accept the invite
4. Sally clicks the button, signs into her github account and then is redirected to sign into her UCSBNetId account through Campus SSO.
7. Sally and Frank can now start collaborating with Regina on the code in the organizations or repositories that they were invited to.  

## Outside Collaborators

Organization, project, and repository owners can collaborate with people outside UCSB, using the "[Outside Collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization)" feature of Github. [Outside Collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization) will not need to login using an UCSBNetID.

In order to access a UCSB Github repository as an outside collaborator, the outside person must:
 - [ ] Have an active Github account AND 
 - [ ] Be invited to a UCSB Github repository, organization or project AND
 - [ ] Be listed by the repository or organization owner as an outside collaborator
