# GitHub Organization Naming Standard
This describes the naming convention used for organizations created as part of the GitHub program.

Organization names should follow the format _prefix-id-name_ using the guidelines below. The maximum length of the organization is 39 characters.

## Prefix

All organizations should begin with _"ucsb-"_.

## Identifier

The identifier should be a recognizable name that relates the repo to a department in the format _"id-"_. For student organizations not related to a department _stu-_ should be used.

## Postfix

The postfix should be descriptive of the organization, such as the purpose or name of the team/lab.

## Exceptions

There may be situations that require deviation from the naming standard outlined in this document. Valid exceptions include:

+ Public organizations with a well established name
+ Applications specific requirements
+ Organizations annexed into the program

Exceptions will be vetted with the Github administrators.
