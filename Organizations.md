## Github Organizations

UCSB Github is split into multiple "Organizations." There is a [primary UCSB Organization](https://github.com/ucsb).
Organizations are distinct shared areas where groups can collaborate across many projects. 
Organization administrators can manage member access to their org's data and projects, without having to coordinate with a central Github Administrator.

All Organizations must have at least one designated owner. Owners are responsible for their organization, and are required to attend training or other mandated events as part of the Github service. 
Organizations that do not have an active or responsive UCSB owner, may be scheduled for removal/deletion.

### Org Owner Requirements & Expectations
 - [ ] All orgs must have a minimum of two active UCSB owners (this helps prevent orphaned repositories)
 - [ ] Responsible for configuration and maintenance of their organization
 - [ ] Responsible for being main point-of-contact for projects and users within their organization
 - [ ] Mandatory membership in a google group / mailing list (managed by Github Admins) for announcements & information
 - [ ] May be required to attend Github training and provide proof of completion within 1 month of org creation
 - [ ] May be required to periodically attest that their organization is still active/needed.
 - [ ] Failure to comply with requirements may result in the owner's organization being deleted

Note: Requirements (some mandated by Github directly) may change at any time, and will be communicated to existing organization owners as soon as possible.
